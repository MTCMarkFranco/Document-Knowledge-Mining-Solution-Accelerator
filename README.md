### Solution accelerator overview

This solution accelerator helps you ingest, extract, and classify content from a high volume of assets to gain deeper insights and generate relevant suggestions for quick and easy reasoning. It allows you to analyze, compare, and summarize content with multi-modal processing of documents, handwritten text, charts, graphs, tables, and form fields. It leverages Azure OpenAI and Azure AI Document Intelligence in a hybrid approach by combining Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and multi-modal Large Language Model (LLM) to extract information from documents to provide insights without pre-training.

### Key features

- **Ingest and extract real-world entities:** Process and extract information unique to your ingested data pipeline such as people, products, events, places, or behaviors. Used to populate filters.

- **​Chat-based insights discovery​:** Choose to chat with all indexed assets, a single asset, select a set of assets, or chat with a  generated list of assets from a based on a user-led keyword search.

- **Text and document data analysis:** Analyze, compare, and synthesize materials into deep insights, making content accessible through natural language prompting. 

- **Prompt ​suggestion ​guidance:** Suggest a next best set of questions based on the prompt inquiry. Include referenced materials to guide deeper avenues of user-led discovery.

- **​Multi-modal information processing:** Ingest and extract knowledge from multiple content types and various format types. Enhance with scanned images, handwritten forms, and text-based tables.​

### Scenario

In large, enterprise organizations it's difficult and time consuming to analyze large volumes of data. Imagine a mortgage lender working with both residential and commercial clients and she facilitates financing for buyers and sellers by negotiating loan terms, processing mortgage applications, and ensures compliance with federal regulations. 

Her challenges include:
- Analyzing large volumes of data in a timely manner, limiting quick decision-making.​
- Inability to compare and synthesize documents limits the contextual relevance of insights.​
- Inability to extract information from charts and tables leads to incomplete analysis and poor decision-making.

The goal of this solution accelerator is to:
- Automate document ingestion to avoid missing critical terms and ensure accuracy.​
- Leverage extracted data to make better-informed loan decisions.​
- Accelerate loan approvals while reducing manual effort.

### Business value

**Automate content processing** <br/>
Process and extract essential details unique to your ingested data pipeline such as people, products, events, places, or behaviors to quickly streamline document review and analysis.

**Enhance insight discovery**<br/>
User-led insight discovery is enabled through indexed, single, and multi-asset selection, including user generated asset lists used to contextualize, compare and synthesize materials into deep insights.

**Increase user productivity**<br/>
Improve productivity with natural language prompting and next best query suggestion, including reference materials and automated filter generation, to guide deeper avenues of user-lead discovery.

**Surface multi-modal insights**<br/>
Data ingested from multiple content types, such as images, handwritten forms, and text-based tables, is extracted and analyzed to surface key insights in conversational context.


### Who should use this solution accelerator?

Developers should use this solution accelerator in scenarios where they need to extend the capabilities of Azure OpenAI on their data, particularly when dealing with complex data analysis or document processing tasks that go beyond standard use cases. For example, when there is a need to integrate and analyze multiple data modalities (e.g., text, images, structured data) to gain comprehensive insights.

The accelerator presented here provides several options, for example:
- Data ingestion pipeline
- Entity mapping
- Key phrase and topic analysis
- Semantic search
- Chat with Unstructured (RAG 2.0)
- Image Processing
- Multi-modal processing 
- Natural language text analysis and summarization
